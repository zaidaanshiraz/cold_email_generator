📧 Cold Email GeneratorProject OverviewThe Cold Email Generator is a sophisticated, AI-powered tool designed to streamline the outreach process for services companies. It leverages the power of the Groq API for rapid LLM inference, LangChain for complex prompt orchestration, and Streamlit for an interactive user interface.The core function is to generate highly personalized and compelling cold emails by integrating three key data sources:Job Market Demand: Extracts live, specific job listings from a target company's careers page URL.Portfolio Matching (Vector DB): Queries an internal vector database (not explicitly visible in the UI, but part of the backend architecture) to find the most relevant project examples or case studies that align with the required skills in the job description.Personalized Outreach: Uses the gathered demand data and portfolio matches to craft a targeted cold email, positioning the service provider's dedicated resource as a superior, faster alternative to the standard hiring process.🎯 The Scenario: Why This Tool MattersImagine the following scenario, which this tool is designed to solve:The Target: Nike is currently spending significant time and resources in the traditional hiring process (recruitment, onboarding, training) to fill a role like Principal Software Engineer.The Solution: Atliq, a Software Development company, has a highly skilled, dedicated software development engineer ready to deploy immediately.The Outreach: The Business Development Executive (Mohan) from Atliq uses this Cold Email Generator to reach out to Nike. The resulting cold email immediately addresses Nike's specific pain points (the open job role) and offers a tailored solution with relevant proof points (portfolio links) that directly match the job description's requirements, bypassing the slow hiring loop entirely.🏗️ Architecture DiagramThe system operates on a layered architecture, integrating web scraping, vector search, and a large language model for personalized output.🚀 Set-Up and InstallationTo get the Cold Email Generator running locally, follow these steps.1.
